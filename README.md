- Supertest

## File structure
- Use MVC structure and modularise as much as possible

## Todos
### Client-side validation
- Regex in pattern attribute (HTML)
- Required attribute in all input fields (HTML)
- Use a script.js to validate everything again, before form is submitted
- In script.js also compare passwords. If password is not the same donâ€™t post form
- Alert() user if there is any problem using script.js

### Server-side validation
- When form is received in backend run it through another validation process using a promise doing similar checks in front end. If any error  reject and show error message in terminal
- Show message in terminal if validation is successfully

### Database
- Create SQL script with a dummy account
- Db_connection file for pool (to connect to db)
- Db_build to build database to heroku and local (test database)
